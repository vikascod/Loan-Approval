## 1. Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
- Python (>=3.6) installed
- Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Necessary packages and libraries installed (pip install -r requirements.txt)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/vikascod/Loan-Approven-EndtoEnd-Project.git
    cd Loan-Approven-EndtoEnd-Project


## 2. Data
Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [data_source_url]. You can download it from [data_source_download_link] and place it in the data/ directory.

Data Description
The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including features like gender, marital status, education, income, and more. The target variable is whether the loan was approved or not.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning
Handle missing values.
Remove duplicates.
Handle outliers if necessary.
Feature Engineering
Create new features if relevant.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize or scale numerical variables.

## 4. Model Training
Classification Models
Train various classification models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc.
Hyperparameter Tuning
Use hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance.

## 5. Model Evaluation
Metrics
Evaluate models using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Best Model Selection
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
